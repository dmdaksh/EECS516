# Medical Imaging Reconstruction Projects

This repository contains three comprehensive projects that explore different techniques and methodologies for image reconstruction using ultrasound, MRI, and CT technologies. Each project is implemented in MATLAB, with detailed well-documented code and plots.

## Ultrasound Beamforming

Implement beamforming and scan conversion algorithms for a simulated ultrasound system.

## MRI

Implement a Bloch equation simulator to demonstrate the functioning of a spin-warp pulse sequence with slice selection.

## CT

Implement and compare different methods of reconstructing an image from a set of projections using CT data.
